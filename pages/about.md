## About Foxfire Unsolved

Foxfire Unsolved is a database of in-depth profiles for unsolved cases, initially focused on the province of british columbia, and later expanded to the rest of colonial canada. In our part of a world there's a lack of faith in our investigative authorities' diligence and many are simply forgotten. This project seeks to consolidate information from various sources (public records, private print archives, social media, current news coverage, etc) and build clear pictures of the many victims, both as a resource to aid the large online 'true crime' community's investigations, and so that they may be remembered.
